FCA-Zero: Automated Clinical AI Governance & Risk Audit Engine
Developed and Certified by Eulolia
FCA-Zero is a proprietary clinical audit kernel designed to provide a "safety layer" over Medical LLMs and EHR documentation. It is specifically engineered to eliminate the "Silent Killer" gap—clinical red flags that are documented in narrative notes but missed by human review or standard algorithmic filters.
🛡️ The 100% Gold Master Validation
Under the leadership of Eulolia, FCA-Zero has achieved a landmark 100% Accuracy Rating on the Gold Master 125 Dataset.
• Sensitivity: 100% Detection of high-liability "Toxic" cases (Aortic Dissection, Sepsis, Cauda Equina).
• Specificity: 100% Recognition of "Safe" clinical anchors (zero "Alert Fatigue" for clinicians).
• Bias Mitigation: Built-in detection for Socioeconomic and Language-based clinical dismissal.
📈 Commercial Value & Pilot Programs
FCA-Zero is currently available for integration with:
• Medical Malpractice Insurers: To automate risk-adjustment and lower payout exposure.
• Health Systems: To provide real-time clinical safety nets in Urgent Care and Emergency environments.
• AI Developers: To provide a deterministic "Safety Governor" for generative medical AI.
